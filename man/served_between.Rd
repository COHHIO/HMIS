\usage{
served_between(., start = ReportStart, end = ReportEnd, lgl = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.}{\code{(data.frame/tibble)} Input to be filtered. In a \code{magrittr}
pipe this will always be the first object}

\item{start}{\code{character/Date} of the end of the timeframe. Characters
in format mdY, Ymd, dmY acceptable.  \strong{Default \code{ReportStart}} will be
automatically retrieved from parent environments if not specified. If end is
named other than ReportStart, it must be specified.}

\item{end}{\code{character/Date} of the end of the timeframe. Characters in
format mdY, Ymd, dmY acceptable.  \strong{Default \code{ReportEnd}} will be
automatically retrieved from parent environments if not specified. If end is
named other than ReportEnd, it must be specified.}

\item{lgl}{\code{logical} Flag to force logical vector output. \strong{Default \code{FALSE}}}
}
\value{
\code{data.frame/logical} after filtering/applying conditional to the
appropriate columns
}
\description{
Filters a dataframe of Enrollments with an Entry Date on or prior
to your Report Start Date and either a null Exit Date or the Exit Date is on
or after your Report End Date. This would include any household whose stay
overlaps the date range at all.
}
\details{
Context-sensitive: Automatically detects if nested inside
of \link[dplyr]{filter} call, if so returns \code{logical} instead of \code{data.frame}
