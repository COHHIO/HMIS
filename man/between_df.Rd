\usage{
between_df(., status, start = NULL, end = NULL, lgl = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{.}{data.frame/tibble. In a \code{magrittr}, pipe this will always be the
first object}

\item{status}{character, One of "served", "stayed", "entered", "exited",
"operating", or "beds_available".
\describe{
\item{"served"}{ Enrollments that overlap the date range specified,
based on Entry and Exit Dates. Equivalent of \code{served_between()}}
\item{"stayed"}{ Enrollments that overlap the date range specified,
based on Exit and the Entry Dates for ES, SH, TH projects and Move In Dates
for RRH and PSH projects. Requires an EntryAdjust variable in the
dataframe. EntryAdjust is based on the ProjectType of the ProjectID
associated with the Enrollment and a valid MoveInDate. (Future version will
not require EntryAdjust as long as ProjectType and a valid MoveInDate are
present in the dataset.) Equivalent of \code{stayed_between()}}
\item{"entered"}{ Enrollments where the Entry Date is in the date
range specified. Used to find households who entered during date range.
Equivalent of \code{entered_between()}}
\item{"exited"}{ Enrollments where the Exit Date is in the date range
specified. Used to find households who exited during date range.
Equivalent of \code{exited_between()}}
\item{"operating"}{ Projects where the Operating Start and End dates
overlap the date range specified, including those with null Operating End
Dates. Equivalent of \code{operating_between()}}
\item{"beds_available"}{ Projects with active beds during the date
range specified. Equivalent of \code{beds_available_between()}}
}}

\item{start}{Default = ReportStart, character/date of the start of the date
range. Characters in format mdY, Ymd, dmY acceptable. Will be automatically
retrieved from parent environments if not specified. If start is named other
than ReportStart, it must be specified.}

\item{end}{Default = ReportEnd, character/date of the end of the date range.
Characters in format mdY, Ymd, dmY acceptable. Will be automatically
retrieved from parent environments if not specified. If end is named other
than ReportEnd, it must be specified.}

\item{lgl}{Default = FALSE, logical, flag to force logical vector output.}
}
\value{
\code{data.frame/logical} after filtering/applying conditional to the
appropriate columns
}
\description{
Context-sensitive quick filtering or output of logical based on
a date range. All assumptions about the data are based on the most recent
\href{https://www.hudexchange.info/resource/3824/hmis-data-dictionary}{HUD HMIS Data Standards}.
The family of *_between functions helps HMIS data analysts easily shape
enrollment or project descriptor data based on a single date range, avoiding
errors and repeated code.
}
\details{
Context-sensitive: Automatically detects if nested inside
of \link[dplyr]{filter} call, if so returns \code{logical} instead of \code{data.frame}.
Enrollment-related functions require Enrollment data elements such as Entry
Date, Exit Date, Move In Date, and Project Type (of the Enrollment's Project).
Project Descriptor-related functions require Project data elements such as
Operating Start/End dates and Bed Inventory Start/End dates.
